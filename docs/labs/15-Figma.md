## Overview
Have you heard of Figma before this class? If so, this lab is for you. 

This lab will be teaching you the simplest core functions of figma to help you create a seamless connected UI across all screens in your Comp 55 Projects.

Figma is a powerful tool to help you line up your ideas before you begin coding them, which is a nice thing to do if you generally like to jump in and begin programming.

Upon completing this lab you will know how to:
- Create a figma project
- Add objects onto your figma project
- Edit object's properties
- Be able to port the design into comp 55

Submission for this lab will be:
// TODO am I even allowed to add submissions in the first place?

## Creating Your Figma Account
To Get Started with this lab, we will assume you've never touched figma before and need to start from the first opening of the website.

Navigate to [Figma](www.figma.com) and then continue.

You'll immediately see a pretty website however we want to just create an account.

Find the button in the upper right corner that says "Get started for free"

I would reccomend just using your school email, so just click on "Continue with Google"

_If you want to use your personal email you can jump to [here](#personal-email)_

Then Click on your signed in school account.

Then it should take you into your home screen.

Now you have successfully created your Figma account.

#### Personal Email

So to create an account using a personal email you will need to just fill in some fields instead of just pressing a few buttons.

You will need to type in your email address and a password for this new account.

I would reccomend to disable the figma emailing list, but that's up to you to keep.
